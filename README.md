# OpenPythonAPI
## Overview

This program can be ran via any computer/terminal with python 3.12 installed. Libraries needed can be installed via pip (python's module manager)

Open source Application utilizing the OpenExo API to search, connect to, and controll NAU Biomecatronics Lab's OpenExo systems.

This project uses the MIT License.

The purpose of this project is to provide an open source solution for controlling the OpenExo system that is accessible to anyone and free to modify for their needs.

## Intallation Guide

BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) is the heart of this project which provides a connection from this API to the exoskeletons. Bleak, a python library is used to handle all BLE operations. To find out more about Bleak click [here](https://bleak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Other libraries that are required include:
 - matplotlib
 - async_tkinter_loop
 - pygame
 - async_tkinter_loop
 - numpy
 - bleak
 - pandas
 - scikit-learn
 - micromlgen
 - matplotlib
 - pygame


To install all of the libraries for this program run the command in any terminal `python .\install_dependencies.py` where main() is found

## Operation of API
### Program control flow
<img src="./prgramflow.png">
This program when starting up creates a window with tkinter. To start scanning for exo-skeletons make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your computer or device. If Bluetooth is not enabled, the program will throw an OS error.

To start the program run the command in any terminal `python3 GUI.py` which is where main() is found and will initialize the windows and frames of the program.

## Adding a button

To add a button to the application, follow these steps:

Select a Frame: Choose a frame in the PythonApplication\views\ folder where you would like to add the button.

Integrate the Button: Hereâ€™s an example of how to add a button in a specific frame:

class YourFrame(tk.Frame):
    def __init__(self, parent):
        super().__init__(parent)
        self.create_widgets()

    def create_widgets(self):
        my_button = tk.Button(
            self,
            text="My New Button",
            command=self.my_button_action
        )
        my_button.pack(pady=10)

    def my_button_action(self):
        print("My New Button was clicked!")

Functionality: Define what the button will do in the my_button_action method.

## Modifying the Graphing

To modify the graphing functionality, you can adjust the BasePlot class and its subclasses. Here's how to do it:

Limit Points Displayed: In the update_plot method, modify the max_points variable to control how many points are displayed in the graph:


def update_plot(self, xValues, yValues, secondY, title):
    max_points = -20  # Change this value to display more or fewer points
    xValues = xValues[max_points:]
    yValues = yValues[max_points:]
    secondY = secondY[max_points:]

Customize Axes and Titles: In the update_plot method, you can also adjust axis labels and titles:

self.ax.set_title(title)
self.ax.set_xlabel("Time")
self.ax.set_ylabel("Value")

Implement Animation: Each plot subclass (e.g., TopPlot, BottomPlot) has an animate method that gathers data and updates the plot. Modify this method to change how data is sourced and displayed.

## Adding a New Frame
To add a new frame to the application, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create the New Frame Class
    Create a new Python file in the views folder (e.g., newFeature.py).

    Use the following template to define your new frame:
    
import tkinter as tk

class NewFeature(tk.Frame):
    def __init__(self, parent, controller):
        super().__init__(parent)
        self.controller = controller

        label = tk.Label(self, text="New Feature Frame", font=("Arial", 24))
        label.pack(pady=20)

        button = tk.Button(self, text="Go to Scan Window",
                           command=lambda: controller.show_frame("ScanWindow"))
        button.pack(pady=10)

### Step 2: Update the ControllerApp Class
    Open your main application file.

    Import the new frame at the top:

from views.newFeature import NewFeature

    Add the new frame to the frames dictionary in the ControllerApp class:


for F in (ScanWindow, ActiveTrial, UpdateTorque, BioFeedback, MachineLearning, NewFeature):

### Step 3: Navigate to the New Frame
    You can add a button in any existing frame to navigate to the new feature:

button = tk.Button(self, text="Go to New Feature",
                   command=lambda: controller.show_frame("NewFeature"))
button.pack(pady=10)
